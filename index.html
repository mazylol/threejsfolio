    <h2>ðŸ“œ Manifesto</h2>
     <p>
      Hello there! I'm Mazy, but people in real life call me Landon. I am a programmer based out of my mothers basement. I am 15 so it's not weird I swear. I enjoy making discord bots in languages such as Python, C, and recently Rust.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
      This all started around early 2020. Quarantine was in full swing, I was bored out of my mind. I used discord a lot, and I have always been interested in technology, so I made a discord bot. Then another. Then another. Until I found a genuine love for programming. Nowadays I have still make bots, but I have found interest in other things, such as web development and an Arch install script.

    <h2>Bots</h2>
    <hr> 
    <h3>Mazbot</h3>
      <p>
       My first discord bot, and the most featured. This does simple responses, images, memes from reddit, weather, possibly more.
      </p>

     <h3>Garfield</h3>
      <p>
       First discord bot in C. It really was just to learn the basics. All it does is post images of Garfield the cat upon command.
      </p>

     <h3>Coder</h3>
      <p>
       This bot pretty much was going to contain documentation for all of the major languages. It is very very early in development.
      </p>

      <h3>Mathcord</h3>
      <p>
       This is my only bot in TypeScript. It does simple math via slash commands. It is not much but it does what it needs to.
      </p>

      <h3>ArchBTW</h3>
      <p>
       This my first major project in C. It is going to tell users why to use Archlinux.
      </p>

      <h3>HistCord</h3>
      <p>
       This is a big project, not very finished. Will basically be a giant knowledgebase on various languages.

    <h3>Archmazy</h3>
    <p>
     This is a script based on my personal preferences to install Arch Linux. It works, sometimes. It configures the system, installs dwm, and sets up a few other things.

    <h3>Mazfolio</h3>
    <p>
     This is my other portfolio. It was made in react and it is a little less jank than this site.
